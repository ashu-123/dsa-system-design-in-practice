# 📚 DSA & System Design in Practice

Welcome to **DSA & System Design in Practice** — a curated collection of real-world, practical implementations of system design concepts and data structures using **Java**.

This repository showcases how common features from modern applications are built under the hood. From tracking the **most recently used emoji** on a smartphone keyboard to finding the **most frequently used emoji**, each module includes a detailed breakdown of the **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **design decisions** involved.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RecentEmojis.java`       | Implements logic for tracking the most recently used emojis, similar to smartphone keyboards. Uses a combination of doubly linked lists and hash maps.                 |
| `AutoCompleteSystem.java` | Implements logic for autocomplete search system, similar to google search, youtube search. Uses a combination of Tries and Priority Queue(for hot search suggestions). |
| `linkedInRecommendations` | Implements logic for linkedIn skill based recommendation suggestions. Uses Graph traversal techniques, Priority Queue for top skill matches and Sets.                  |
| _More coming soon..._     | Additional real-world inspired system designs and DSA problems.                                                                                                        |
